THIS TASK IS CENTERED AROUND UNDERSTANDING AND IMPLEMENTING THE CONCEPT OF FILE HANDLING IN C++. THE PROGRAM SHOWCASES THE ABILITY TO INTERACT WITH TEXT FILES USING STANDARD FILE STREAM CLASSES PROVIDED BY C++: ofstream, ifstream, fstream. THE FILE OPERATIONS ARE ENCAPSULATED WITHIN A CLASS NAMED FILE, PROMOTING MODULARITY AND OBJCET ORIENTED DESIGN.
1. WRITING:
   WRITING IS AN OUTPUT OPERATION. FOR THIS PURPOSE THE PROGRAM UTILISES THE OBJECT OF THE OFSTREAM CLASS. A FILE NAMED data.txt IS OPENED USING THE open() FUNCTION IN OUT MODE (ios::out). WHEN A FILE IS OPENED      IN THIS MODE, IT EITHER CREATES A NEW FILE IF ONE DOESNT EXIST OR OVERWRITES THE EXISTING CONTENTS OF FILE.
   GETLINE IS USED TO TAKE AN INPUT STRING THAT IS TO BE WRITTEN INTO THE FILE.
   cin.ignore() IS USED TO IGNORE LEFTOVER CHARACTERS IN INPUT BUFFER ENSURING CLEAN INPUT HANDLING.
   ONCE THE USER ENTERS THE DATA, IT IS WRITTEN TO THE FILE USING THE << INSERTION OPERATOR, AND A CONFORMING MESSAGE IS DISPLAYED.
2. APPENDING:
  APPENDING IS ALSO AN OUTPUT OPEARTION. HENCE IT USES THE OBJECT OF THE OFSTREAM CLASS. NOW THE FILE IS OPENED IN APPEND MODE(ios::app). APPENDING DIFFERS FROM WRITING BECAUSE IT ADDS DATA AT THE END OF EXISTING   CONTENT RATHER THAN OVERWRITING IT. 
  GETLINE IS USED TO TAKE INPUT STRING  AND cin.ignore() TO IGNORE CHARACTERS IN INPUT BUFFER JUST LIKE IN WRITING.
  THE ENTERED TEXT IS APPENDED TO THE FILE, FOLLOWED BY SUCCESS MESSAGE. THIS ENSURES THAT PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN CONTENT IS PRESERVED, AND THE NEW CONTENT IS ADDED AFTER IT.
3. READING:
   READING IS AN INPUT OPERATION. HENCE IT USES THE OBJECT OF THE IFSTREAM CLASS. NOW THE FILE IS OPENED IN IN MODE (ios::in).
   GETLINE IS USED TO READ THE CONTENTS OF THE FILE LINE BY LINE UNTIL THE END OF FILE IS ENCOUNTERED.
   THE END OF FILE IS CHECKED WITH THE HELP OF eof() FUNCTION.
   THIS IS FACILITATED USING A WHILE LOOP. THE LOOP GOES ON THE END OF THE FILE AND ENSURES ALL THE CONTENTS OF THE FILE ARE READ FOLLOWED BY PRINTING IT.
   AFTER READING THE FILE IS CLOSED USING in.close() FUNCTION.
THE APPLICATION IS DESIGNED TO BE MENU DRIVEN TO MAKE IT USER FRIENDLY. THIS IS IMPLEMENTED USING A do while loop AND A SWITCH CASE STATEMENT. THE USERIS REPEATEDLY PROMPTED TO SLECT AN OPERATION: WRITE, APPEND, READ OR EXIT. BASED ON THE USER'S CHOICE THE CORRESPONDING MEMBER FUNCTION OF THE FILE CLASS IS INVOKED. THIS STRUCTURED APPROACH MAKES THE PROGRAM INTERACTIVE AND USER FRIENDLY.
IN CONCLUSION THE PROGRAM PROVIDES A COMPLETE DEMONSTRATION OF FILE HANDLING IN C++, SHOWCASING HOW TO WRITE, APPEND, AND READ FROM TEXT FILES USING OBJECT ORIENTED PRINCIPLES. IT ADHERES TO BASIC PROGRAMMING BEST PRACTICES LIKE ERROR CHECKING, USER INPUT VALIDATION, AND CLEAR OUTPUT MESSAGES, MAKING IT A STRONG INTRODUCTORY LEVEL FILE HANDLING PROJECT.
